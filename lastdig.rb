#SPOJ Problem Set (classical)
#
#3442. The last digit
#
#Problem code: LASTDIG
#
#
#
#
#Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000), a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of a^b.
#
#Input
#
#The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.
#
#Output
#
#For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.
#
#Example
#
#Input:
#2
#3 10
#6 2
#
#Output:
#9
#6
