#        http://www.spoj.com/problems/LASTDIG2/
#Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives two
#numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Pappu with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1<=d<=1000) and the index b (0 <= b <= 922*10^15). You
#                                     end
#have to find the last digit of a^b.
#
#                                                         Input
#The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow. For
#each test case will appear a and b separated by space.
#
#                                                         Output
#For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.
#
#Example
#Input:
#3
#3 10
#6 2
#150 53
#Output:
#9
#6
#0
#THis solution gets AC on spoj with Time = 0.11
